#      Installing      #
########################

This was installed on a server running Ubuntu 10.04. It should work on any machine as long as it is running a webserver and PHP (5+).
If you are using a different authentication method, you may need something more. Check the PHPAuth requirements here:
https://github.com/korylprince/PHPAuth

If you are running this on a windows box, you need to edit the commands and find a replacement for grep, tail, sed, etc.

Simply copy the PHPLogViewer folder to your web directory and edit auth/options for authentication options and auth/logviewer.php for your list of logs.
Then simply navigate to your website and login. 

If you have any issues or questions, email the email address below, or open an issue at:

#          Usage          #
###########################

This distribution is a simple web interface for checking looking at log files.
The default username/password is administrator/admin.

You can select the log type from the select box in the top left.
You can search the log with the textbox.
You can set the amount of lines to show with the select box in the middle.
You can set the page to autorefresh for different amounts of time.
The "AutoRefresh" text acts as a toggle switch. If it is red then autorefresh is activated.

If you wish to change authentication (say for AD integration) then edit auth/options.php.

To add or edit logs, you need to edit the $validTypes array in auth/logviewer.php.

An entry in the array looks like:
"entryname"=>array("command when all lines should be shown","command when set amount of lines should be shown")
In addition, each of the commands should include the text "<search>" where the search term from the user will be inserted.
"<lines>" should be in the second command where the user will specify the number of lines to show.

The default config is for a DNS/DHCP server.

If you wish to add or delete types, you must do so in logviewer.php but also in main.php (Delete or add the options to the select.)
To edit the autorefresh times simply edit main.php and add the options to the select.

This builds upon the "PHPAuth" Library:
https://github.com/korylprince/PHPAuth
The authentication can be extend using that library. Note: sessions must be used.
